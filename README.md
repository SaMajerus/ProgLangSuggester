# Programming Language Suggestor 

#### By Samuel Majerus

#### User completes a 5-question quiz before program displays the Programming Language (ProgLang) suggested for them. 

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* JavaScript
* CSS
* MarkDown (for this README) 
* Git Bash (for navigating local directories, interacting with remote GitHub repo)

## Description
The user answers 5 questions, and clicks the submit button. What happens between their answers being submitted and the ProgLang suggestion being displayed? I'll explain that now. 



## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Files required for the program to execute normally: 'pLangQz.html', 'js/scripts.js'. 
  * I highly recommend downloading the 'css/styles.css' files as well, to enhance readability through formatting and organization.   
* In the installation folder, the files 'styles.css' and 'scripts,js' must stored in folders named 'css' and 'js', respectively. These two folders -- with the aforementioned files stored respectively -- must also be in the same folder location as the HTML file, otherwise the interactive nature of the program will not be there on the webpage when the HTML file is run (by double-click). 
  * Basically, assuming 'styles.css' is stored in a folder named 'css' and  'scripts.js' is stored in a folder named 'js', then for the application to function after initial execution, the listing of files and folders stored in the containing folder in which these files were installed must look something like this (assume that names with a '/' at the end are folders):  
    'pLangQz.html'    'css/'    'js/'  

* Once the program is running (the webpage is open in your browser), everything else should be self-explanatory.  To clear your answers and take the Quiz again, simply reload the page. 


## Known Bugs

* The points system for the four language-suggestion options is rudimentary to say the least, since I came up with it on the fly and only cared about the program being functional in some sense of the word.  (I didn't have time to do thorough testing and make tweaks wherever they were needed, hence why demonstrating that the basic system worked was my main concern.)
As a result, it's entirely possible that Javascript will be suggested to the user most of the time, especially since the answer-processing system's second-stage is biased towards JavaScript to some degree. It's also possible for the other 3 respective languages to be suggested in some cases as well --  at the end of the day, it really just depends on which answer combination is chosen by the user.
