<!--The 4 languages I've chosen as suggestion options for this Quiz are the following: 
  C#
  Javascript 
  Python 
  Swift [which is similar to Java, if memory serves.] 
-->

  <h1>Programming Language Suggestor - A Quiz</h1>  

  <!--In my opinion, one should eventually learn all 4 of these (in addition to some others, like C, Java, HTML, etc, but that's just me.)-->
  <p>
    The following quiz will ask you some questions. Then, based on your answers, it will suggest at least one -- out of 4** -- Programming Languages to learn. 
    **These are: 
    <ul> 
      <li> 
        C# ("C-sharp")
      </li> 
      <li> 
        Javascript 
      </li> 
      <li> 
        Python 
      </li> 
      <li> 
        Swift
      </li> 
    </ul>
  </p> 

  <p>You may start whenever you're ready</p>
